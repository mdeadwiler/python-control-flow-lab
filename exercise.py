# Exercise 1: Vowel or Consonant
#
# Write a Python function named `check_letter` that determines if a given letter
# is a vowel or a consonant.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should prompt the user to enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) and determine its type.
# - It should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print: "The letter x is a vowel."
# - If the letter is a consonant, print: "The letter x is a consonant."
# - Replace 'x' with the actual letter entered by the user.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Utilize the `in` operator to check for vowels.
# - Ensure to provide feedback for non-alphabetical or invalid entries.

def check_letter():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    val = input('Enter a letter a-z or A-Z: ').lower()
    print(f'The user entered {val}')
    if val == 'aeiou':
        print("The letter {val} is vowel.")
    elif val.isalpha():
        print( "The letter {val} is a constant.")
    else:
        letter == "a"
        new_letter == letter.replace("a", "x")
# Call the function
check_letter()

# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    age = int(input("Please Enter your age: "))
    print(f'This user is elgible to vote based on {age}!')
    age = 18
    if 18 == age:
        print("Validated!")
    elif user <= age:
        print("Validated!")
    else:
        print("not of age!")
# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()

# Exercise 3: Calculate Dog Years
#
# Write a Python function named `calculate_dog_years` that calculates a dog's age in dog years.
# Fill in the logic to perform the calculation inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to enter a dog's age: "Input a dog's age: "
# - Calculate the dog's age in dog years:
#      - The first two years of the dog's life count as 10 dog years each.
#      - Each subsequent year counts as 7 dog years.
# - Print the calculated age: "The dog's age in dog years is xx."
# - Replace 'xx' with the calculated dog years.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Convert the string input to an integer using `int()`.
# - Apply conditional logic to perform the correct age calculation based on the dog's age.

def calculate_dog_years():
# Your control flow logic goes here
    dog_age = int(input("Dog's age: "))
    print(f'My Dog Sparky is {dog_age}!')
    first_two = 20
    if first_two + 7:
        print(str(dog_age))
    elif dog_age != first_two:
        print("Dog is not born!")
    else:
        new_dog_age = str(first_two)
        dog_age = age.replace(first_two, new+dog_age)
        print("The dog's age in year is {age}!")
# Call the function
calculate_dog_years()

# Exercise 4: Weather Advice
#
# Write a Python script named `weather_advice` that provides clothing advice based on weather conditions.
#
# Requirements:
# - The script should prompt the user to enter if it is cold (yes/no).
# - Then, ask if it is raining (yes/no).
# - Use logical operators to determine clothing advice:
#   - If it is cold AND raining, print "Wear a waterproof coat."
#   - If it is cold BUT NOT raining, print "Wear a warm coat."
#   - If it is NOT cold but raining, print "Carry an umbrella."
#   - If it is NOT cold AND NOT raining, print "Wear light clothing."
#
# Hints:
# - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in your if statements to handle multiple conditions.

def weather_advice():
    # Your control flow logic goes here

# Call the function
weather_advice()
